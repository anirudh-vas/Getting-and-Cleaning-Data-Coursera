# Code Book

## Data Collection
Raw data was obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository. We used the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, that was used by the original collectors to conduct experiments exploiting Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Activity Recognition (AR) aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. 

## Subject: the integer subject ID.
Activity: the string activity name:
Walking
Walking Upstairs
Walking Downstairs
Sitting
Standing
Laying
Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
